# Turkish Word Finder

  Firstly, I created a list that contains all Turkish words. The algorithm takes user input which are letters then put them into letter_list. After that, with the help of itertools module it finds the all permutations of letter_list's elements and put the output into founded_list.


  Finally we get the intersection of founded_list and turkish_words list to find the correct words and print them out.
